C implementation of Dijkstra algorithm

The input for the program should be text file of format:
    "nb s d
    c1 c2 c2...
    ....
    ...
    ..           "
where nb is number of points, s is starting point, d is destination
from the next line it must be a matrix of costs

compile & run the program using makefile
--> make
To compile the program
-->make exec  

returns distance and best path to the destination point
